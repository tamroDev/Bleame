    descriptionComment:
      "This little device is incredible! I thought I'd give it a go and that it was probably a gimmick. It's not! It's awesome! So good, that my 18 and 20 yo daughters have 'borrowed' it, and I have to find it whenever I need it! It actually works and I have sent the link to my sisters and girlfriends! Love it. No mess and it exfoliates as well. Love it! 10 stars! Great Christmas presses too ðŸ¥°",

    titleComment: "My experience",
    descriptionComment:
      "I really liked the fact that I didnâ€™t have to use a razor for sure. My skin is too sensitive for a razor so this was a nice change. But.. I think Iâ€™m in the trial and error stage haha I can say that my legs were incredibly soft and hairless after use BUT in some spots I most definitely over used it. Kinda burny like rug burn haha so NOTED I think my next time using it, I wonâ€™t have that issue. My leg hair is very light and when I had my second son, almost 5 yrs ago,.. thatâ€™s the last time I shaved my legs. I decided it was too much work, too time consuming and it really left my legs hurting. I just had my third child, my daughter and she will be 10 months in a week, so this is the first time in a LONG LONG TIME that I have done anything about my legs (they were always super soft, I exfoliated etc, Iâ€™m not a monster lol) and so it had 5 years of hair growth to get through and it STILL took way less time than a razor. Miracles pplâ€¦ itâ€™s the tiny miracles that make the world go around. Im very impressed. And canâ€™t wait to continue using your product. ",

    descriptionComment:
      "I was a bit skeptical and thought the ads I was seeing for this was just people paid to hype it up. I am not one of those people. When I tell you this is worth the hype, itâ€™s worth the hype!! To really put this to the rest I let my leg hair grow out until it got delivered. Just received it today and I was so excited, i used straight out of the package! Only regret is not buying this sooner!!! if youâ€™re skeptical just DO IT you wonâ€™t be disappointed!! You can clearly see in the photo which half I used it on and if that doesnâ€™t convince you, idk what will!",

      "Very good. I was skeptical at first but it really works great. Be careful not to rub too hard for you might end up with friction burns like I did on my first use. Nothing too serious. The second time around, I did only gentle circular motion for about 10 minutes and it was done.",
